Quick &amp; Easy image conversion tool for OS X

How does it work?
-----------------
Select an output format and drag individual images or whole folders onto the marked area.

Where are the converted images?
-------------------------------
In the same folder where your image has been, or in the parent folder of the folder you dragged (cleario?).

Why can't I choose a different location for the converted images?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I'm working on that...

Thats all very nice, but I'd also like it to do...
--------------------------------------------------
Just submit an issue and I see what I can do.
